Prerequisites
  To run the simulation, you need the following software and libraries.

Required Software
  IDE: Processing 4.3 (www.processing.org)

Required Libraries
  controlP5: This library is used for controlling the graphical user interface.
  G4P (GUI for Processing): This library is used for creating and controlling GUI elements in   Processing.

Installing the Libraries
Step-by-Step Guide
  1. Install Processing:
    Download Processing 4.3 from the official website and install it.
  2. Add Libraries:
    Open Processing 4.3.
    Go to the menu Sketch > Import Library... > Add Library....
    Search for controlP5 and click Install.
    Search for G4P (GUI for Processing) and click Install.
  
Running the Project
  1. Download the project directory and unzip the file.
  2. Open the Processing IDE.
  3. Select File > Open... from the menu and navigate to the unzipped project directory.
  4. Open the main file of the project (usually a .pde file).
  5. Click the Run button (the triangle icon) in the top left corner of the Processing IDE to start the simulation.

Troubleshooting
- Missing Libraries: Ensure that the controlP5 and G4P libraries are correctly installed. Verify this by going to Sketch > Import Library... in the menu and checking for the libraries.
- Versions: Make sure you are using the correct version of Processing (4.3), as other versions may be incompatible.
